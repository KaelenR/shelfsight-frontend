# Task 3 - Load Testing and Multi-User Testing (k6)

This folder documents Task 3 deliverables for ShelfSight (k6 scenarios, concurrent workflow coverage, measured performance, and current system limits).

Implementation and result artifacts are owned by the backend repository (`shelfsight-backend`).

## A. Scope and flows

Covered backend workflows:

- Auth: login, session check, logout
- Catalog: search, filter, detail
- Circulation: loan list, checkout, checkin
- Ingestion: job list, ISBN lookup, analyze upload, job detail/reject

| Tool             | k6 (`grafana/k6:0.49.0` if local k6 is unavailable)        |
| Seed credentials | default seed users, password `password123`                 |
| Data state       | users:`16`, books: `50`, copies: `100`, loans: `132` |

## C. Scenarios implemented

### Smoke suite

- File: `tests/k6/scenarios/smoke.js`
- Purpose: fast validation of core auth/catalog/circulation behavior
- Profile: single VU, 5 iterations

### Multi-user suite

- File: `tests/k6/scenarios/multi-user.js`
- Profile: `task3` (2 minutes)
- Peak concurrent VUs: 45

## D. Results summary

### Smoke

| Metric            | Value     |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Iterations        | 5         |
| HTTP p95          | 258.06 ms |
| HTTP avg          | 63.12 ms  |
| HTTP failure rate | 0.00%     |
| Checks pass rate  | 100%      |

### Multi-user

| Metric              | Value              |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Iterations          | 3531               |
| HTTP requests       | 9453               |
| Peak VUs            | 45                 |
| HTTP p90            | 184.13 ms          |
| HTTP p95            | 279.74 ms          |
| HTTP avg            | 55.50 ms           |
| Max request latency | 1223.93 ms         |
| HTTP failure rate   | 0.00%              |
| Checks pass rate    | 100% (14602/14602) |

### Per-flow request latency (p95)

| Flow        | p95       |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Auth        | 362.89 ms |
| Catalog     | 267.52 ms |
| Circulation | 265.45 ms |
| Ingestion   | 258.63 ms |

### End-to-end flow latency (p95)

| Flow             | p95        |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Auth flow        | 691.60 ms  |
| Catalog flow     | 565.70 ms  |
| Circulation flow | 831.40 ms  |
| Ingestion flow   | 1226.90 ms |

### Threshold status

All configured thresholds passed:

- Global HTTP error rate threshold
- Global check pass-rate threshold
- Scenario-level request latency thresholds
- Flow-duration latency thresholds

## E. Bottlenecks and current limits

- Ingestion remains the slowest end-to-end path (`ingestion_flow_duration p95 = 1226.90 ms`).
- Circulation showed minor contention (`checkout_conflicts = 3`).
- Circulation also showed inventory skew during concurrent paging (`empty_copy_pools = 239`).
- Load harness update: expected circulation contention responses (`409`) are now explicitly treated as expected for `loan_checkout` and `loan_checkin_pre`; contention is tracked through counters instead of inflating failure rate.
- Catalog and auth remained stable under peak concurrent load.

Validated limit from this run:

- 45 concurrent VUs across 4 workflows for 2 minutes
- 9.4k+ HTTP requests with zero HTTP failures and full checks pass

These limits are for the current seeded dataset (~50 books / 100 copies). Revalidation is required after Task 1 large-scale data population.

## F. Recommendations

1. Re-run the same suite at 10k+ and 100k dataset milestones.
2. Increase available-copy pool for circulation scenarios to reduce data-contention noise.
3. Track ingestion p95/p99 in CI as a release-health signal.
4. Add a longer soak profile (10-15 minutes) to detect gradual degradation.
