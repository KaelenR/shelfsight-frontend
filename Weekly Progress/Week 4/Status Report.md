## Test Login Credentials

The following seeded accounts are available for testing. Each role sees a different dashboard and has different navigation access.

| Role | Email | Password | Dashboard Features |
|------|-------|----------|--------------------|
| **Admin** | `admin@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Full system stats, AI recommendations, quick links to all features (Ingest, Map, Members, Reports). Sees all sidebar items. |
| **Staff** | `staff@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Daily task checklist, circulation activity, shift-relevant stats. Sidebar includes Circulation and AI Ingest but not Members or Reports. |
| **Patron** | `patron@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Current loans with due dates, personalized book recommendations, reading stats. Sidebar limited to Dashboard, Catalog, and Library Map. |

> **Note:** The backend must be running (`npm run dev` in `shelfsight-backend/`) and the database must be seeded (`npm run db:seed`) for these credentials to work. The backend runs on port 3001 and uses HttpOnly JWT cookies for authentication.
