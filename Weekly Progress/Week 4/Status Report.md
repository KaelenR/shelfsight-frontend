| **Mirza Baig** | **Tasks completed:** |
| | • Rebuilt the interactive library map page using React Flow with drag-and-drop shelf placement |
| | • Designed and implemented custom shelf nodes with compact UI, color coding, and capacity indicators |
| | • Added shelf settings panel with editable fields (name, category, Dewey range, tiers, rotation, etc.) |
| | • Built shelf viewer modal showing book spines per tier with hover tooltips and status indicators |
| | • Added 360-degree node rotation with slider and preset buttons |
| | • Implemented undo/redo history, node resizing, snap-to-grid, and canvas export |
| | • Completely Redesigned frontend with more modern branding and ui|
| **Time Spent:** 16 hours | **Planned tasks for next week:** |
| | • Continue iterating on the map feature based on feedback |
| | • Work on improving other frontend pages |
| | **Any issues or challenges:** |
| | • React Flow has no native rotation support — solved with CSS transforms on the node component |

| **Marc Manoj** | **Tasks completed:** |
| | • Implemented full frontend authentication flow (login page with validation, error handling, loading states) |
| | • Created `AuthProvider` context and `useAuth()` hook for global auth state management |
| | • Built API service layer (`api.ts`, `auth.ts`) with typed error handling and `credentials: 'include'` |
| | • Added route protection to dashboard layout — unauthenticated users redirected to login |
| | • Updated sidebar to display logged-in user's name and role |
| | • Implemented backend auth system (auth service, controller, routes, JWT middleware) |
| | • Set up bcrypt password hashing, HttpOnly cookie-based JWT storage |
| | • Created `requireAuth` and `requireRole` RBAC middleware |
| | • Updated seed data with properly hashed passwords |
| | • Ensured all credentials/API keys loaded from env vars — no hardcoded secrets |
| | • Created `.env.example` for frontend, updated backend `.env.example` with `JWT_SECRET` |
| | • Updated `CLAUDE.md` documentation to reflect new auth flow and file structure |
| **Time Spent:** 12 hours | **Planned tasks for next week:** |
| | • Connect catalog page to real `/books` API |
| | • Begin circulation UI integration |
| | **Any issues or challenges:** |
| | • React 19 changed Context.Provider JSX usage — required adjusting the AuthProvider pattern |

**Total Time Spent: 42 hours**

**Summary:**
Week 4 focused on building out core infrastructure across both the frontend and backend. The interactive library map was rebuilt using React Flow with drag-and-drop shelf placement, custom shelf nodes, a settings panel, a book-spine shelf viewer, and features like undo/redo, snap-to-grid, and canvas export. The frontend was also redesigned with more modern branding and UI. Full authentication was implemented end-to-end: the frontend gained a login page with validation, an AuthProvider context, route protection, and role-aware sidebar display, while the backend received JWT-based auth with HttpOnly cookies, bcrypt password hashing, and RBAC middleware. Backend development also delivered the basic book and user CRUD APIs, user role setup (Admin, Staff, Patron), and updated seed data for auth testing. On the planning side, sprint tasks were broken down, an AI agentic development outline was drafted covering OCR, metadata enrichment, and Dewey classification, and the backend project structure was reviewed for clean separation of concerns. No hardcoded secrets remain, and `.env.example` files were created for both repos.

## Test Login Credentials

The following seeded accounts are available for testing. Each role sees a different dashboard and has different navigation access.

| Role | Email | Password | Dashboard Features |
|------|-------|----------|--------------------|
| **Admin** | `admin@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Full system stats, AI recommendations, quick links to all features (Ingest, Map, Members, Reports). Sees all sidebar items. |
| **Staff** | `staff@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Daily task checklist, circulation activity, shift-relevant stats. Sidebar includes Circulation and AI Ingest but not Members or Reports. |
| **Patron** | `patron@shelfsight.com` | `password123` | Current loans with due dates, personalized book recommendations, reading stats. Sidebar limited to Dashboard, Catalog, and Library Map. |

> **Note:** The backend must be running (`npm run dev` in `shelfsight-backend/`) and the database must be seeded (`npm run db:seed`) for these credentials to work. The backend runs on port 3001 and uses HttpOnly JWT cookies for authentication.
